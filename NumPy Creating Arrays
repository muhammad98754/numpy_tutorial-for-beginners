#1-D Arrays=an array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.

#2-D Arrays
#An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.

#An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.

#Higher Dimensional Arrays

#An array can have any number of dimensions.

#When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument.

import numpy as np
a=np.array([1,2],ndmin=3)
print(a)
print(a.ndim)

#confused??
#ndim  use for check the dimension
#ndmin use for defining the dimension of array
