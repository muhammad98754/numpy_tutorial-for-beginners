NumPy is a Python library.

NumPy is used for working with arrays.

NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists.
